* Math Learning Notes in Orgmode

A simple repository to place my math study notes.

** Emacs Setup

You can either use my github config
https://github.com/dryman/felix-emacs-config or use the following snippet in your .emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((gnuplot . t)))
(setq org-startup-with-inline-images t)
(add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-redisplay-inline-images)
#+END_SRC

The setup is mainly for using gnuplot in orgmode. Below is a minimal demo.

** Example plot

To plot a math function in org, you can use gnuplot in org-babel section. Here is the snippet for drawing a sin(x) function and embed the plot in emacs.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file img/demo.png :term png small size 480,320 :exports both
plot sin(x)
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you were running emacs org-mode and have the snippet above pasted in, type ~C-c C-c~ to trigger the gnuplot org-babel. Then you should see the results as below.

#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file img/demo.png :term png small size 480,320 :exports both
plot sin(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/demo.png]]

The default terminal output size is 640,480 and is too large for me. If you are fine with that you can omit the ~:term~ setting.

You can change the ~:export~ setting to get just the plot by ~result~, only code ~code~, both ~both~ (which I used in this example), or nothing ~none~. This changes the behavior of how it shows up on github page. The default is ~code~ only.
