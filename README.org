* Math Learning Notes in Orgmode

A simple repository to place my math study notes.

** Emacs Setup

You can either use my github config
https://github.com/dryman/felix-emacs-config or use the following snippet in your .emacs

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((gnuplot . t)))
(setq org-startup-with-inline-images t)
(add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-redisplay-inline-images)
#+END_SRC

The setup is mainly for using gnuplot in orgmode. Below is a minimal demo to embed gnuplot output in orgmode:

** Example plot

#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file img/demo.png :term png small size 480,320 :exports both
plot sin(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:img/demo.png]]

The default terminal output size is 640,480 and is too large for me. If you are fine with that you can omit the ~:term~ setting.
